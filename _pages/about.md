Welcome! I'm <b>Samyo Acharjee</b>, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Daffodil International University. Currently, I'm a researcher at the <b>Health and Informatics Research Lab (HIRL)</b>, focusing on  intersection of machine-learning and healthcare.

I specialize in <b>medical imaging</b> and radiological interpretations, using <b>deep learning</b> to assist radiologists in identifying disease indicators swiftly and accurately.

During my undergrad, I excelled in <b>programming competitions</b>, sharpening my <b>problem-solving</b> skills and contributing as a judge and problem setter.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to impact healthcare positively, I also enjoy <b>photography</b>, capturing nature's beauty, and I'm a proud <b>Real Madrid</b> fan.

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm <b>Samyo Acharjee</b> , a recent graduate from <b>Daffodil International University</b> with a degree in <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b>. Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of <b>medical technology</b> as a <b>researcher</b> at the <b>Health and Informatics Research Lab (HIRL)</b>.

My passion lies at the <b>intersection</b> of <b>computer science and healthcare</b>, particularly in the realm of <b>medical imaging</b>. In my role at HIRL, I delve into the intricate world of <b>radiological interpretations</b>, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques to enhance the <b>capabilities of radiologists</b>. Through the power of <b>AI</b>, I aim to <b>assist healthcare professionals</b> in swiftly identifying potential indicators of diseases within <b>medical images</b>, thus contributing to more accurate diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

During my undergraduate journey, I actively engaged in various <b>programming competitions</b>, where I honed my <b>problem-solving</b> skills and showcased my prowess in algorithmic thinking. Beyond competing, I also had the privilege of serving as a <b>judge and problem setter</b> in several competitions, allowing me to give back to the vibrant <b>programming community</b> that has shaped my journey.

I'm driven by a relentless curiosity and a <b>genuine desire</b> to make a <b>positive impact</b> through my work.

I'm also an <b>avid photographer</b> with a keen eye for capturing the <b>beauty of nature</b>, adept at capturing the serene landscapes and <b>sporadic beauty</b> of the natural world. Oh, and I'm a <b>Real Madrid</b> fan too!

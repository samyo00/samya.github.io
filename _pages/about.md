Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Samyo Acharjee , a recent graduate from Daffodil International University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of medical technology as a researcher at the Health and Informatics Research Lab (HIRL).

My passion lies at the intersection of computer science and healthcare, particularly in the realm of medical imaging. In my role at HIRL, I delve into the intricate world of radiological interpretations, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques to enhance the capabilities of radiologists. Through the power of AI, I aim to assist healthcare professionals in swiftly identifying potential indicators of diseases within medical images, thus contributing to more accurate diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

During my undergraduate journey, I actively engaged in various programming competitions, where I honed my problem-solving skills and showcased my prowess in algorithmic thinking. Beyond competing, I also had the privilege of serving as a judge and problem setter in several competitions, allowing me to give back to the vibrant programming community that has shaped my journey.

When I'm not delving into the depths of code or analyzing medical images, you'll likely find me exploring new technologies, tinkering with projects, or simply unwinding with a good book. I'm driven by a relentless curiosity and a genuine desire to make a positive impact through my work.

Join me as I embark on this exciting journey of exploration, innovation, and discovery. Together, let's push the boundaries of what's possible and harness technology to transform healthcare for the better.

I'm also an avid photographer with a keen eye for capturing the beauty of nature, adept at capturing the serene landscapes and sporadic beauty of the natural world. Oh, and I'm a Real Madrid fan too!
